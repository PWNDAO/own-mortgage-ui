            How Does The Mortgage Work?
        </h4>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
            This mortgage is a decentralized, crowdfunded DeFi loan designed to bootstrap community projects by leveraging crypto collateral (WETH) with a 75% loan-to-value ratio over two years. 
            Supporters lend stablecoins (EURS) at a modest interest rate of 2%, receiving gradual loan repayments along with non-monetary rewards like memberships and event access. 
            By distributing risk across many lenders instead of relying on one, this setup encourages community involvement and ensures more accessible and sustainable funding.
